Textbook: Starting Out with C++ from Control Structures to Objects (8th Edition) by Tony Gaddis


Programming Challenges problems from
the Loops and Files chapter of the textbook:

1.Sum of Numbers
Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program
should use a loop to get the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number
entered. For example, if the user enters 50, the loop will nd the sum of 1,
2, 3, 4, ... 50.
Input Validation: Do not accept a negative starting number.


17.Sales Bar Chart
Write a program that asks the user to enter today's sales for ve stores.
The program should then display a bar graph comparing each store?s sales.
Create each bar in the bar graph by displaying a row of asterisks. Each
asterisk should represent $100 of sales. Here is an example of the program's
output.
Enter today's sales for store 1: 1000 [Enter]
Enter today's sales Enter today's sales for store 2: 1200 [Enter]
Enter today's sales Enter today's sales for store 3: 1800 [Enter]
Enter today's sales Enter today's sales for store 4: 800 [Enter]
Enter today's sales Enter today's sales for store 5: 1900 [Enter]
SALES BAR CHART
(Each * = $100)
Store 1: **********
Store 2: ************
Store 3: ******************
Store 4: ********
Store 5: *******************


19 Budget Analysis
Write a program that asks the user to enter the amount that he or she has
budgeted for a month. A loop should then prompt the user to enter each
of his or her expenses for the month and keep a running total. When the
loop finishes, the program should display the amount that the user is over or
under budget.


20 Random Number Guessing Game
Write a program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess
what the number is. If the user?s guess is higher than the random number,
the program should display ?Too high, try again.? If the user?s guess is lower
than the random number, the program should display ?Too low, try again.?
The program should use a loop that repeats until the user correctly guesses
the random number.
